### Info
As discussed with Malini, the recruiter, my main experience is with VueJS framework. As far as React goes, I do have some experience, although mainly in fixing bugs in existing code - never had to actually build anyting from scratch in React.

While I am pretty sure I could deliver what you asked for in React, I would require few extra days in order to do so. As such the deliverd example is made with VueJS.
